# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Image Recognition
Since the dawn of technology, computers have been there as a friend to those who need one in the moment, with games created to take the place of a human counterpart.  The game I created provides some company in a game as classic as it can get: rock, paper, scissors.  Though originally starting as a raspberry pi project, I've made something that I'm equally as proud of and learned while doing it that part of engineering is adapting and growing with your project.

# Final Milestone

The final outcome of my project is a game which the user can decide if they want to play or not and a computer will play against them.  In the end, this computer is told to start cheating and win every time after the user wins 5 rounds.  At this program I've learned about machine learning, overfitting a model (meaning it was trained on a data set too specific), python coding, the command line, and more.  Although I faced more challenges than I anticipated, I am glad that I did because it taught me more than if everything had simply gone smoothly.  Though my raspberry pi discouraged me, using Google Colab expanded my computer science knowledge and I couldn't be happier.

# Second Milestone

Continuing working in colab, for my second milestone I advanced into making image detection a working game.  Trying to address some issues I saw in my first milestone with correctly identifying the images, I looked back through the original data set (that was used for training the model) and figured out how to most efficiently crop the image that my camera was taking so that my hand would be similar to the hands that trained the machine learning model.  In the future I want to work on making the code flow more smoothly and also giving the computer the option to cheat to win.  The original project I selected had used the pi camera to track the movements of the player's hand and accurately guess what move they are going to make, so I want to include a flare of that in my final project.

# First Milestone

The original project I selected would've included a raspberry pi and a pi camera; however, technical difficulties led me to switch gears and move to working solely with google colab.  My original objective when choosing this project was to learn about machine learning and be able to apply training a model to a data set other than the Rock, Paper, Scissors images.  Although these issues are not ideal, I know that they are a huge part of the engineering process, especially if I decide to continue into Computer Science.  For this first milestone I was able to connect my camera to google colab and correctly identify whether the picture I took was Rock, Paper, or Scissors and though when I selected the project I thought I'd be using the command line to code on the raspberry pi, coding with python on google colab has still been enriching.  

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
```

# Project Materials
To do the project that I ended up completing, all that you will need is a free Google Account and a laptop to run Google Colab on!  Google Colab is accessible by everyone and there are tons of pretrained models and other resources readily available for use.
The rock, paper, scissors pre-trained model is here.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
