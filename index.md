# Project Name Here
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# Final Milestone

**Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

Continuing working in colab, for my second milestone I advanced into making image detection a working game.  Trying to address some issues I saw in my first milestone with correctly identifying the images, I looked back through the original data set (that was used for training the model) and figured out how to most efficiently crop the image that my camera was taking so that my hand would be similar to the hands that trained the machine learning model.  In the future I want to work on making the code flow more smoothly and also giving the computer the option to cheat to win.  The original project I selected had used the pi camera to track the movements of the player's hand and accurately guess what move they are going to make, so I want to include a flare of that in my final project.

# First Milestone

The original project I selected would've included a raspberry pi and a pi camera; however, technical difficulties led me to switch gears and move to working solely with google colab.  My original objective when choosing this project was to learn about machine learning and be able to apply training a model to a data set other than the Rock, Paper, Scissors images.  Although these issues are not ideal, I know that they are a huge part of the engineering process, especially if I decide to continue into Computer Science.  For this first milestone I was able to connect my camera to google colab and correctly identify whether the picture I took was Rock, Paper, or Scissors and though when I selected the project I thought I'd be using the command line to code on the raspberry pi, coding with python on google colab has still been enriching.  

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
